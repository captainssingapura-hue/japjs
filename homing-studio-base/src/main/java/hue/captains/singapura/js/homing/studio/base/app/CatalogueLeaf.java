/**
 * RFC 0015 — sealed family of things that can appear as a leaf in a
 * {@code DocTree} (the umbrella term for {@link Catalogue} and the
 * upcoming {@code ContentTree}). Realises the leaf-kind closure axioms
 * from the DocTree ontology (T3, T4).
 *
 * <p>Two permits:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Doc} — content-bearing leaf. The default presumption:
 *       most leaves are Docs. Realises DocTree T4's "content leaf"
 *       variant.</li>
 *   <li>{@link StudioProxy} — structural leaf. RFC 0011 cross-tree
 *       portal — names another tree's root rather than carrying content.
 *       Realises DocTree T4's "tree-root reference leaf" variant.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Future structural carve-outs (external links, search shortcuts,
 * mount points) extend the permits list explicitly via this ontology
 * entry — the framework refuses implicit non-Doc leaves.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Phase 1 of RFC 0015.</b> This interface is introduced as a typed
 * marker; existing {@link Entry} variants continue to carry their
 * payloads in the {@code OfDoc}, {@code OfApp}, {@code OfPlan},
 * {@code OfStudio} sum. Phase 2-6 of the RFC collapses the Entry sum
 * into polymorphism over {@code CatalogueLeaf}; until then, this
 * interface is informational — the typed assertion that Doc and
 * StudioProxy are the two leaf kinds.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why not sealed?</b> The Java sealed-classes rule requires
 * permitted subtypes to live in the same package (in unnamed modules)
 * or the same named module. {@link Doc} lives in {@code studio.base};
 * {@link StudioProxy} lives in {@code studio.base.app}; the project
 * has no {@code module-info.java}. Until the project adopts JPMS
 * modules, the closure is documented and (later) enforced via a
 * conformance test rather than declared structurally. The ontological
 * statement that Doc and StudioProxy are the only two leaf kinds (per
 * DocTree T4) is unchanged.</p>
 *
 * @since RFC 0015 Phase 1
