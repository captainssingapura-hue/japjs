/**
 * A typed reference to a document — markdown, HTML, plain text, JSON, or any other
 * text-based format the studio reader / browser knows how to display.
 *
 * <p>Per <a href="../../../../../../../../../../docs/rfcs/0004-typed-docs-and-doc-visibility.md">
 * RFC 0004</a>, every Doc is identified by a {@link UUID} (the wire identity, stable across
 * Java renames and file moves) and provides its own bytes via {@link #contents()}. The framework
 * never reaches outside the Doc to load anything; the Doc owns its sourcing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Most Docs are static markdown shipped on the classpath next to their record class. Use
 * {@link ClasspathMarkdownDoc} for the dominant case (zero ceremony — record class location
 * implies file location). Other static cases:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link InlineDoc} — contents inlined as a Java text block; no companion file.</li>
 *   <li>{@link ResourceMarkdownDoc} — classpath-loaded but at an explicit path, when the
 *       co-located mirror doesn't fit.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For non-static sources (database, network, generated content), implement {@link Doc}
 * directly and provide a custom {@link #contents()}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Identity vs. addressability</h2>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #uuid()} is the only thing that travels on the wire. Java class names,
 * package, on-disk file path, and even {@link #title()} are all free to change without
 * breaking external links / bookmarks / API references. Generate a UUID once with
 * {@code UUID.randomUUID()} (or a JShell session), paste as a {@code static final UUID}
 * constant, and never edit it again.</p>
 *
 * @since RFC 0004
