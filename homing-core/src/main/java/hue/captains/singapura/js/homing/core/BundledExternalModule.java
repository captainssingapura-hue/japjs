/**
 * A 3rd-party JavaScript library bundled at build time and served self-contained.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link ExternalModule} (which loads from a CDN at browser request time
 * via a hand-written wrapper JS file), a {@code BundledExternalModule} ships the
 * library bytes inside the homing.js classpath. The browser's {@code import}
 * statement is satisfied entirely by the homing.js server — no external network
 * call is ever made at runtime.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Two halves of the contract</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Java side (this declaration)</b> — a typed manifest of what names
 *       the bundled JS file exports. Used by the framework's import-writer so
 *       user code gets type-safe {@code import { Scene } from <ThreeJs>} resolution.
 *       The framework does <i>not</i> emit {@code export} statements for these —
 *       the bundled JS file already declares them natively.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>JS side (the bundled file)</b> — a real ES module obtained from a CDN
 *       at build time, with all transitive imports inlined ({@code esm.sh} {@code ?bundle}
 *       flag is recommended), checksum-verified, and copied onto the classpath
 *       at {@link #resourcePath()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Server-side behavior</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code EsModuleGetAction} short-circuits when it sees a {@code BundledExternalModule}:
 * it ships {@link #content()} bytes verbatim, skipping the writer machinery entirely
 * (no imports prefix, no exports suffix, no css/href injection). The bundled file
 * is the entire response.</p>
 *
 * <h2>When NOT to use this</h2>
 *
 * <p>Libraries that aren't ESM (UMD-only, CommonJS-only, or globals-polluting like
 * jQuery) need a hand-written wrapper JS file that adapts the surface to ES module
 * conventions. Use {@link ExternalModule} for those — increasingly rare in the modern
 * ecosystem (2025+).</p>
 *
 * @param <M> the self-type for typed exports
